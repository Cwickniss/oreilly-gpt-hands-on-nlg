The filling texture seems margarine-y to me (somewhat like whipped Crisco) rather than the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness I remember. Also, the flavor seems less pronounced, and the hazelnuts are definitely not as fresh and crunchy as they once were.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, or perhaps this is a shipping version of the recipe, better suited to handle temperature swings and rough handling.

I did not buy this here...<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />I've tried laxatone, lax'aire, catlax, and cisapride.  Though my cat loved the taste of them (except for the laxatone which he eventually got sick of), none of them fixed his constipation problem.  He was struggling to go and going anywhere and everywhere in the house.  I mixed this food 50-50 with our regular Science Diet Mature Formula and now he actually has diarrhea.  I've cut down to about 40% of the new cat food and we almost have it right.  The cat's poop stinks horribly, but at least he can go and it's in the litter box. It's only been a couple of weeks so I don't know about long-term results...<br /><br />UPDATE (Sept, 2012):<br />  Long-term results are great! We call this the pooping food. :) This still works fantastic and I have all of my cats eating it, even though only one of them actually needs it. They also all love the taste and seem to mine for this cat food when I have it mixed with another one. The cats have adjusted to it so they could probably eat it straight now (no more diarrhea), but it's so expensive that I think I'll still mix it (FYI, you can find this cheaper elsewhere online or possibly from your vet; it's not in regular pet stores). I'm at about a 50-50 mix again, partly just because the cats like this stuff so much. I quit mixing with Science Diet since the formula seems to have changed and it smells awful now (neither I nor the cats seem to want to tolerate that). We've sometimes had problems (e.g., throwing up) with the cats when the cat food has run low in the dish because the cats already ate all/most of the royal canin, but that might be from the gross Science Diet formula. I've gone to 1/2 meow mix now, with no ill effects, but the cats still try to pick out the royal canin. I'll probably try to mix with a more generic royal canin one next. I guess the point is that it doesn't matter what you mix this stuff with, as long as your cats like the mix.<br />  Although I'm completely sold on this cat food since I no longer have to worry about being on the lookout for poopy surprises (yuck!), there is a drawback. If your cats tend to throw up or get hairballs, this cat food seems to stain the carpet more than other foods. Sometimes I can't get the yellowish stain out even with my tried and true SpotShot spray and PetBot machine, which have never failed me before. Good luck. If you're reading this, you and your cat are probably very frustrated. Hope this stuff helps you too! I'm throwing away all of the prescription and OTC laxatives I bought because I haven't used them once since I started this food. They better keep making this stuff!!!"

They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.

The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well."

Definitely has a sweet potato flavor, so if you don't like that vegetable, you probably won't like the flavor of these.  One bag (0.8 oz or 23 g) contains 19 chips, has 100 calories, 3 g of fat, 95 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium.  That isn't bad compared to many other snack foods.  For example, a comparable size bag of regular potato chips would have about 130 calories and 8 g of fat.  However, these Popchips don't taste like regular potato chips.  If you like the fatty, salty flavor of regular potato chips but are trying to cut back, I would recommend a reduced fat kettle chip variety instead.<br /><br />After reviewing the ingredients of these ""natural"" Popchips, they are not as healthy as I expected.  The first two ingredients are rice flour and sweet potato FLAKES.  The remaining ingredients are tapioca starch, sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil, organic yellow corn flour, seasoning (sea salt, dried cane syrup, maltodextrin, sweet potato powder, natural flavor, citric acid), sugar, and annatto (natural color).  They contain no fiber nor vitamin A, which I would expect to find in a sweet potato product.<br /><br />All in all, the Sweet Potato Popchips are not a bad snack to munch on when compared to many other processed snacks foods.  Obviously, something along the lines of an apple or some plain popcorn would be a healthier choice for a snack, but certainly would not be as enjoyable!"

I mix a scoop of the powder with some unsweetened almond milk, just a bit of fruit and some chia seeds and it tastes good. It does have a bit of an earthy taste, a kick of sorts but it doesn't bother me at all and I'm glad that you don't have to add tons of sugary fruit to cover up the taste.<br /><br />As far as how it works, the powder is a great meal replacement or another meal if you're trying to gain weight. The powder itself provides 11g of Protein(with the sprouted flax one providing 13g and the standalone hemp powder one providing 15g) and they all have about 120-140 calories so adding 2 scoops, some milk and some fruit and even some nuts is a good calorie boost. It also provides a lot of energy due to the protein being easily assimilated and the maca being an excellent energy booster on its own.<br /><br />Nutritionally, this thing is a champ with a great Omega 6:Omega 3 ratio(3:1 which is the optimal healthy range) as well as being a great source of dietary fiber to keep the intestinal tract healthy and having many vitamins and minerals(being an excellent source of Zinc and Vitamin E, 2 minerals which can be hard to get in our daily diets).

Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.

When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.

I do wish that these were biodegradable.  But, instead of collecting the big grocery bag plastic bags, I am going to use these smaller bags for poop and my cloth bags for groceries.  Right now, the bags are a little big for my puppy, but I am sure she will grow into them...gross."

Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked.  At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain.  Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price.  So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I received my bottle in only two days using Amazon Prime.  It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging.  After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room.  The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time.  Our mouths watered immediately.  Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away.  The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste.  My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage.  My money did not go to waste.<br /><br />At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken.  I only wanted to pour a little on.  I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle.  I was wrong.  A big glob covered my meal.  My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken.  But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife.  I did not want to waste it.  So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing.  What a dumb thing to do.  The next half hour was torture.  My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not.  I drank all of my soda fast.  I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough.  I was in bad shape.  I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies.  Dave...You got me.<br /><br />On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning.  Use a drop at a time.  Bah! Stupid me.  Well...you know what they say.  Good stories usually start out with a bad decision.<br /><br />This product should come with a dropper.  It is definitely a favorite in my book.  I will buy it again but with more respect for the sauce."

As soon as I got the product, my son and I put together a terrific dish with this! After reading the two recipes on the back, here is what we improvised: Chop up half a small cabbage, an onion, two cloves of garlic, two stalks of celery, a red bell pepper and a few small portabella mushrooms. Saute in about a Tablespoon of olive oil. Soak the noodles for a minute or so. Add the noodles to the mix. Add one small can of chopped anchovies, along with the oil from the can. My son put lots of red pepper (cayenne) in, and I thought it would be too much, but it was actually delicious in it. We had a package of portabella mushroom soup in the fridge, so I added about a third cup of that for flavor and moisture. With this package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, a little imagination we concocted a delicious hot dinner dish. The only thing I would have added if I had some would have been some seafood--such as scallops and/or shrimp. Bits of chicken would have worked nicely, too. It was quite filling and satisying. I will probably get more of this brown rice vermicelli to keep on hand for quick dishes."

Another reviewer described this water as having a ""silky taste"" but I could not get the dry like, metalic taste out of my mouth after I drank this.<br /><br />My family did not seem to like this either.  My Husband stated he preferred tap water, after I fixed him a glass.  My 9 year old son made a face as he tried to drink it, stated he did not want to finish it, and proceeded to pour the rest down the sink.  My 11 year old tried it, stated he liked milk more than any other kind of beverage, and also said he did not want more.<br /><br />Again, for the health benefits the company advertises related to this water, perhaps that is why some people have given this water rave reviews.

They really seemed to like the cat food with fish in it, and my friend swears by the Weruva foods.  So I went ahead and ordered a case of 24 - 3 oz cans.  And of course, both cats loved it!<br /><br />But there's one thing that's really nagging at me.  Weruva cat foods, according to their ""advertising"" on the label, are manufactured and processed in a facility that processes human food.  To me (but what do I know?) it seems like a good thing for the cats, and perhaps not such a good thing for me.  I'm not feeling really great about this whole idea of the place where my food comes from also processes cat food.  The cardboard box gave me a few more clues - since it said in rather large letters - Made in Thailand. (It's also on the individual cans and packages - in really teeny tiny letters.) And so then I thought, ""Well, I don't buy anything from Thailand so I should be ok.""<br /><br />I'm usually not that squeemish - my father was in the meat production business - first as a buyer, then as a USDA live animal inspector and I also spent quite a few years of my childhood on or around farms.  I get the ranch/stockyard/processing plant connection - I've seen it up close and personal.  But then I remembered that Phillips Crab, the makers of the Maryland cakes with restaurants and food processing - which originally came from the Chesapeake Bay - was now processing blue crabs ""farmed"" in Asia.  And it seems that often tilapia in the market comes from Asia.  Now I'm wondering what else is from there - and more importantly - how do they handle their food production that's for the US market.<br /><br />Bottom line - Weruva's great for cats and they love it, but perhaps we need more information on our how our own foods are handled."

I enjoyed a peaceful co-existence with the ants until they decided to break all the rules.  They attacked me while I was mowing the lawn, and invaded the house and helped themselves to the dog's food.<br /><br />This meant war.<br /><br />After doing my research, I decided to buy the Terro Ant Dust.  It was the cheapest, and had high marks from my fellow Amazonians.<br /><br />This stuff works.  I sprinkled it on the dirt ant hill, and watched the ants go crazy and die.  To speed things up, I poked their colony with a stick.  This made hundreds of them pile out of their ant hill and walk all over the white powder.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Terro Ant Dust works.  It doesn't look like the ants eat the stuff.  But, die they do.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Every single time I applied the Ant Dust, I took care to not get it on my hands, eyes, or to breath it in.  Still, I felt sick after each application.  Next time, I guess I'll wear a haz-mat suit so that I avoid all contact with the Ant Dust.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 24 hours, most of the ant hills are without activity.  BUT - new ones have popped up.  Huge ones.  These ants are active.  I hit the new ant hills with more Terro.  Next step - Spray the entire yard with indiscriminate bug killer.

Perhaps they have to grow on me.<br /><br />I like sardines, I love maple syrup, and I usually enjoy smoked foods. The combination of the three, however, is a bit much. By itself, I cannot tolerate the overpowering sweetness combined with a distinct smokiness. The taste of the fish itself has taken a back seat to these two much more dominant flavors.<br /><br />It took me a while to find something that actually worked: cream cheese. Toast, cream cheese, and these sardines created a pretty good open-face breakfast sandwich. Cream cheese has a way of tempering even the strongest flavors (vegemite, smoked salmon, capers, etc). There are probably other good ingredient combinations, but I have yet to find them.<br /><br />Bottom line: These fish are very sweet and quite smoky.

Keep in mind as you make it that the batter will look like batter and NOT yeast dough. Made that mistake the first time I made this and added way too much extra flour. Oops! The second time I made it, I got an extra packet of yeast in the mix and made the bread with 2 packs instead of 1. Boy was that a HUGE loaf of bread. Had to bake it an extra 15 minutes but it was delicious. A word of advice with any gluten free bread - when you first put the loaf pan in the oven to bake the bread, loosely cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil. This will keep the bread from getting overly brown as it bakes, especially for loaves that require a minimum of 60 minutes. Also, add a little extra sweetener (1/4 cup sugar to the flour mix and 1/4 cup honey to the milk mixture that you warm on the stove). This added touch of sweet really makes it zing. Even works well with a diabetic on insulin. Not matter what, give this bread mix a chance. You will be glad you did."

However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours).  It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this).  The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see).  Our other dog (full adult) did fine, however.  Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google ""pill pockets diarrhea"", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds."

One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.<br /><br />I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!  I haven't found anyone to beat their prices!<br /><br />Good luck!"

Just for fun, I purchased Milk Kefir Grains from Keysands and from Lifeway.<br /><br />I have made 4 batches of Keysands Kefir.  These batches did produce a drinkable beverage.  The 4th batch did seem to be getting somewhat thicker than the previous ones.  Overall, the Kefir from Keysands has been more sour than the one from Lifeway.  I do understand that the flavor may change over time.  I will say, though that the replication of the kefir has been impressive.  Even in such a small number of batches, I have significantly increased the number of Kefir grains I own.  Excellent!<br /><br />I feel like the Keysands Kefir is a little more ""touchy"".  If I let it go just a bit too long, it separates aggressively into curdles.  But if I remove it prior to this point, so far the product is a little bit thick, but not overly impressive.  But I do feel like I have to watch it a lot more, and be home to catch it when it is ""done"".  I have now put it in the refrigerator, and am working with the Lifeway Brand.<br /><br />The other brand immediately produced a much thicker kefir, and the curdles were very fine.  Even within two batches of the other brand, I had a thick and smooth result - that didn't need any monitoring or doctoring.  The flavor of the other is, so far, more mild, and the increase in grain size a little more slow.  However, I feel like the other brand does not need to be ""babysat"".  It is OK if it sits a little too long, because I won't end up with a useless pile of super thick milk curdles.<br /><br />Pros:  Rapid increase in number of Kefir Grains, Produces a drinkable - slightly thick beverage with (so far) a fairly sour taste<br />Cons:  Curdles too easily and needs more monitoring, has not yet produced a very thick beverage (although it may with more time/effort - the con being that it is taking more time/effort)"

When I read the reviews about this tea, and saw that women in my predicament were going from so little to producing so much, it gave me hope. While I do have to admit that my milk supply has increased, it is no where near as much as many of the other reviewers have reported. I went from pumping about 2-3 ounces a day (on top of breastfeeding) to pumping 8-10 ounces a day (this in addition to breastfeeding). I have to say that I was slightly disappointed that I did not begin producing as much as some of the other reviewers (I would LOVE to have a freezer supply) and we have had to continue to supplement my son with formula. That being said, I would drink a gallon of this tea a day (no, the taste is not so great at first, but it has grown on me) to be able to give my son an extra ounce of breast milk.

Sometimes I have to eat 2-3 bars at work a day whenever I can because I don't know how my schedule will be and this bar always fits my mood because it doesn't have an overpowering taste or heaviness.

My old standard was the Kashi peanut chewy bar because it is slightly sweet, not heavy and isn't really dry.  But unfortunately a lot of the time the peanuts are rancid.  The Think Smile Cocoa bar is, in my opinion a lot better.  It has a light feel (it contains rice crisps), a mild cocoa taste that isn't over powering, is chewy, not too dry and has a mild sweetness compared to other bars.

Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.

With high fructose corn syrup the opposite is true, it taste synthetic and the after taste is designed to leave you wanting more and it actually causes some issues for people, now the reason I started my review with a comparison of HFCS vs sugar is because no where is it more evident than regular dr peper vs dublin dr pepper. Many of the reviewers have said that this is heaven and while I won't go that far I can tell you with a 4 person taste test this stuff destroys the regular formula out on the market. To tell you how I know its simple, the 4 person taste test team took a regular super market can of dr. pepper(they don't make it in glass anymore) each poured out a small sampling 2 fl ounces, and tasted, each of us had the same prognosis, its way to carbonated and the flavor bites at the tongue, its almost like the tongue and the soda is having a fight and the soda is winning, to continue the test we washed out our mouths with water and did the same with the cups, then after 5 minutes we did the same with the dublin dr pepper, never in my life have I tried this stuff and I can tell you that even though its an expensive habit the soda is satisfying, not only is it smooth its not overly sweet and it does not assault the tongue instead it tastes like how dr pepper should taste and I am converted... I probably should have also mentioned that until I tried ddp I hated the taste of dr pepper they converted me the only complaint is the company that sold it to me ""thebargainbox"" needs to take some lessons in packaging their shipments one of the bottles had broken during shipment and soaked the box in ddp, and it picked up the smells of the warehouse not pleasant. Continuing on everyone in the 4 person group fell in love with this soda and now are planning on picking it up sometime in the future. Instead of suing them snapple should be selling dublin dr. pepper in every freaking store this this stuff would put everyone else out of business.<br /><br />Now its time for the imnportant information, because I know as someone who is trying to watch his weight a little bit I pay attention to this stuff here are the details on the back of the bottle, serving size is 1 8oz bottle.<br />Calorie count: 100<br />Calories from fat: 0<br />Sodium count: 35mg<br />total carbs: 27g<br />Sugars: 27g<br />protein: 0<br /> ingredients: water,imperial pure cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural and artificial flavoring, sodium benozate(preservative), caffeine<br /><br />To be more specific this stuff is almost the same calorie count as the 7.5 ounce 90 calorie cans you can buy in any local food store with a much, much, much, much better taste.<br /><br />If you can force yourself to like regular dr pepper in the store then you absolutely must try dublin dr pepper its better for you and tastes incredible."

However, after awhile she showed only sporadic interest in it.

Being completely ignorant of zappers, it's all new, but this unit works fine.  I test it by touching the wires, to make sure it's on; the shock is not serious, but not something you'd voluntarily repeat, so it's not going to harm animals, pets, neighbors or yourself.<br /><br />There are two modes: grounded and two-wire.  For fence work, the two-wire seems best; the intruders have to touch both wires, so it doesn't bother birds (who only land on one wire).<br /><br />For ground use, you want to ground one wire into the ground, and string the other wire as the ""fence"".  The intruder only has to touch one wire and be standing on the ground.<br /><br />I had it in two-wire mode, with one wire accidentally touching a branch of a tree; the current went up the branch (!) and created a shock several feet up the branch.<br /><br />It's branded Havahart, which is a good name; it does what it's supposed to.<br /><br />Get the aluminum wire, it's easy to cut and splice, and you need some plastic standoffs; if you get the yellow stubby ones, you will have a problem mounting them since they require a post sticking up.  I nailed them directly into a wooden fence or the eave of the house, it's a lot easier than trying to affix them to a large nail stuck into the wood.<br /><br />For ground use, 10"" wire sticks are great; the stubby standoffs do actually affix to the 1/8 wire, and you can adjust the height.<br /><br />Raccoons are members of the cat family, and their stool CAN (does not always) contain brain-worm larvae or eggs.  The life-cycle of these worms starts in the intestines of cats who ingest an infected mouse; for two weeks, they excrete virulent eggs of the brain worms.  The eggs are capable of surviving in salt water or your backyard for up to a year; if someone accidently touches the stool and then food, they get infested.  Moreover, wind-blown dust can contain the eggs.  When a human or a mouse gets infested, the brain-worm eggs hatch; the small worms go right through intestine walls, and settle in nearby cells, exploding them and multiplying to other cells, causing a mild but discernable reaction.<br /><br />The body immune system usually wins, and drives them into encapsulated form, in the brain tissue, but has to continually keep attacking them to stop them from spreading again and destroying the body, cell by cell.<br /><br />Alarmingly, 22% of the people in the US are infested with brain worms; there is no cure, the worms exist in the brain until death, just waiting for the immune system to weaken and let them continue destroying the body.<br /><br />The eggs pass right through sewage systems, which is probably how so meny people get infected, because cities like San Diego have a waiver from normal treatment requirements and dump primary sewage into the Ocean.  The eggs remain a danger for months.  This is also why the Sea Otters are dying in Monterey Bay, because they eat shellfish which are infected by nearby sewage operations where people dump cat litter down the toilet, or else when raccoon droppings get washed into the Ocean.<br /><br />So getting rid of cat and raccoon droppings is a matter of survival, and this is one way to discourage them.  Raccoons like to create ""latrines"" in one area, and the whole Raccoon gang uses it.  Don't let it be your yard, especially if you have kids."

I just knew that I was going to love this Passion tea. Maybe more than I love the Tazo Passion - but alas, No. I loved the Tazo Passion from first taste - fruity, just enough sweetness - the perfect warmth and flavor for my mid-day drink at work and on weekends at home to relax. Just a Tazo loose-leaf tea bag and hot water - no sugar needed, good to the last warm sip. I even always keep my tea bag in the cup and never get a bitter taste; just more good fruitiness. Can't do that with the Coffee Bean Passion. I knew about the possible bitter taste from reading the instructions on the can, so I was prepared to make the adjustment. I steeped the first cup for a short time, savored the aroma before my first sip, but all I got was bitterness. It left a bad taste in my mouth - maybe I steeped it too long. It was a few days before I attempted this Passion again. When I did I decided to time the steep - just 3 minutes and immediately remove the tea bag. It appeared strong, smelled great, but still the bitter taste. So I decided to get comfy and drink it anyway - maybe the taste will grow on me. No. I added some lemon and a touch of sugar to make it tolerable for my taste buds. Tolerable, but not my passion. I didn't pay much attention to the ingredients list before ordering: black tea, malva flower, marigold flower, natural and artificial flavorings - its a black tea blend - not an herbal infusion tea. Makes a big difference. I so wanted to like it, but for my taste and preferences - this tea has nothing on Tazo. I guess I was expecting something different. Its probably the black tea that my taste buds disapprove, as well as the artificial flavorings, I suspect. I have 3 tins of it and I'm probably going to drink it because I hate to waste food - but I do not look forward to it. May be good as an iced tea, with sugar and lemon. Or maybe one of my friends will like it - if so, I will gift the remaining tins with love. Sorry to disappoint - just not for me."

Some other brands contain emulsifiers that keep the material from falling out of the oil and hardening, which can make it easier for beginners.<br /><br />Basic recipe: add lemon/lime juice and salt until thin enough to pour. If you are feeding children or people without a taste for the bitter flavor, you might need to add a little sugar. Don't make it sweet, just take the edge off the bitter."

Then I saw this stuff one day at my grocery store and gave it a try.  It has a strong, complex grape flavor.  It tastes like lightly carbonated grape-juice, not like most grape sodas.  It's not overly sweet and syrupy, and it has no artificial, chemical aftertaste (like Fanta has.)  It's really in it's own category.  It's a lot more expensive, and  normally I pick-up welches for my daily grape fix,  but for a great soda once in a while it's perfect.  Best I've ever had, really.

It is expensive.  But I suppose when you add in the cost of the half-n-half, the coffee, the sugar, and the time to make it, it's not that bad.  It's really more of an indulgence than a necessity.

They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out."

I am a coffee enthusiast, and living in a small town, home roasting is the only way to get fresh roasted coffee as the stores just don't sell inventory fast enough.<br /><br />My first batch of this coffee was great tasting with nice body and earthy flavor I would expect from Sumatran. It was packaged well and I received it in 3 business days.<br /><br />From past experience with store bought Sumatran, I like a city plus or maybe full city roast rather than the very dark vienna or french roast the stores seem to like. Roasted to city plus or full city, this product produces a flavor that is full and earthy, but not over the top like a dark roasted Sumatran can be. Lighter than city plus will taste grassy like most coffee. Just my preference and your experience will tell you what works for you.<br /><br />I read some home roasting how-to articles on the web and tried to roast using an air popper to a city plus or full city, ending up with nice medium colored and evenly roasted batch. The aroma when newly roasted is kind of ""raw"", but after an hour or two it is fantastic.  It wasn't very tricky to roast and I've been able to repeat the results as often as I need fresh beans, usually 6 to 8 oz. of beans each weekend.<br /><br />After letting the roast ""breathe"" for a day, it made great espresso in a 15-bar pump espresso machine with fair crema, and in a 3-cup Italian moka pot. With a coarser grind it was terrific in a French press as well. I haven't tried it in a drip machine. The results have been consistent from batch to batch and I would buy it again."

We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM"">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE"">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW"">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website."

It is by far the best Earl Grey for the Keurig systems and I have tried them all. I went through several of the ""Tea<br />Packages""; random assortments of various teas packaged together available here on Amazon. Most seemed artificial, bland, or simply didn't compare to their bagged counterparts. This was not only my favorite Earl Grey but also one of my favorite teas in general available in K-cups.<br /><br />For a little more perspective, I am an avid tea drinker. I consume 10-15 cups of tea a day. A majority of the tea I consume is Matcha or Hunmatsu-RyokuCha. I never mix sugar or milk into my tea. As such, I am particularly interested in teas that are robust and flavorful and not bitter. The bagged Bigelow is very good, not my favorite bagged Earl Grey but very good none the less. The K-cup variety is very close to the bagged version. For this I applaud them as few others can say this.<br /><br />That being said, our machines are perfectly capable of providing hot water for bagged teas. So why the K-cups? Convenience. Regardless of how good this and other K-cup varieties may be, nothing compares to a slow steep. Be it a bag, steeper or infuser they will always win over the instant cup varieties. However, nothing I have found beats the convenience of the Keurig system when it comes to guests and a good cup of coffee/tea. The Keurig system is so easy to use it takes little to no effort on the hosts part to provide a guests favorite beverage as our guests can brew a cup themselves! It's for this reason alone that I have gone through so many varieties of both to ensure an adequate selection of what I consider a good cup of joe and a great cup of tea."

Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive.

I'm always looking for new things to dress up my normal grilled chicken or fish dinners and this worked well. I used it as a dry rub and while it wasn't overly flavorful, it still added some pop to the meat. I will probably try it as a marinade next time, mixing with a little extra virgin olive oil or the like.<br /><br />I tried the vinaigrette recipe on the bottle and was pleasantly surprised. When blended with olive oil and vinegar (I used cider vinegar since that was what I had available) it has a strong herb flavor without being overpowering. The leftover salad dressing keeps pretty well for a few days and loses nothing in the flavor. In fact I think the flavor got a little stronger after sitting in the refrigerator a few days.<br /><br />This dressing mix is quite versatile and I can see myself testing it out in many ways. Perhaps a seasoning for cooked vegetables instead of he usual salt and pepper, Or maybe as a topping for a baked potato, or mixing into mashed potatoes. Pasta salad, spaghetti sauce, use your imagination and I think you'll enjoy this Herb Filled Salad Dressing Mix as much as I did. Now to try the other two flavors...<br /><br />© Kelley A.

Perfect with a little doctoring...,"This caramel iced coffee mix from Starbucks VIA tastes almost like ordering the real thing from Starbucks, making this a very convenient and cost effective product to drink at home! The instructions say on the package to add 16 ounces of cold water then add milk to taste. My own recipe is for 8 ounces of filtered water and 8 ounces of milk (i usually use 1 percent, may need less milk if using whole). Then, stir the mix thoroughly until completely dissolved. Now, if you want you can add your ice cubes and be done with it. The drink will taste good and sweet as is! However, if you want to really make it taste good, then I suggest doing what I do. I drizzle some Monin caramel over the top. The caramel usually goes straight to the bottom of the cup, which is a good thing because you can then use a straw to suck up a little caramel with every sip, YUM! The monin caramel can be purchased here on amazon! To top it off I use some ready whip, the stuff that you spray out of a can that you get at the grocery store, and drizzle a little more of the monin caramel sauce over the top of that! The end result is just as good or better than ordering from Starbucks....and of course much cheaper!"

Whenever I am out and about and order a chai (or a chai latte) I always ask what the brand they're using is, and if they say ""Big Train,"" I'm good to go. I've been drinking a cup of this mix every day for the last four years, but...<br /><br />Has something changed in the formula? My recent shipment came in and it's just awful. I could smell something was 'wrong' when I opened up the container. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is different, other than to say there is something almost chemically about it. I made my first cup with the mix about a week ago and blanched; it was disgusting.<br /><br />So, I threw out my milk, thinking maybe that was the problem, but no...something is definitely different. I can't afford to just buy another order, so I've been drinking my other mixes, wondering what to do with these cans of mix that is just disgusting.<br /><br />If anyone out there has had a similar reaction to their chai as of late, please let me know. I was just in Washington D.C. for the rally and ordered a chai latte at a wonderful little cafe (and it was Big Train, Spiced Chai) and it was just HEAVENLY, like mine used to be. So...why does my mix taste so terrible?<br /><br />Please help, I love this brand and don't want to have to switch to something else if something has changed in their formula.<br /><br />UPDATE AND EDIT: (In case no one reads the comments, I thought I'd put this here) Over the next few months, as I continued to order Big Train, that problem began to diminish until that strange taste was gone. (It took two more orders until I got a batch that was as good as it always was). I suspect something went on with that particular batch wherever it was made, but now, it's every bit as great as I remember it being. I would absolutely recommend this chai - it combines all of the great spices traditionally found in Indian chai and gives it (what I think of as) a British twist with the sugar, so it's perfect as is."

Before I was diagnosed I took great joy in baking healthy whole-grain treats frugally from scratch and loved the nutty fullness that my breads and treats had.<br /><br />Once I cut out the gluten I continued to enjoy some of the other grains out there, like rice, quinoa, corn, and millet.  I have missed bread and pancakes, especially, however, as those were key parts to some of my favorite breakfasts.  At a recommendation I picked up a packet of this mix to try, skeptical of the gummy or crumbly nasty tasting pancakes I might have to be drenching with syrup just to swallow.<br /><br />As we mixed up the pancakes according to directions, I could tell that this was going to be something special.  It had little flecks from the almond meal that pleasantly reminded me of some of my successful whole grain pancakes (not tough dense things that some people consider food).  The texture was smooth and silky.  As they cooked, there was not the slimy looking top that the previously gummy pancakes had.  They were a little different from wheat pancakes, but still looked amazingly good.  There was very nice browning on the bottom after we flipped them over.  When they were done, they looked like pancakes.  REAL pancakes.<br /><br />Topped with a bit of maple syrup, these were such a treat for my poor abused tastebuds.

Each time the moths appeared we had fewer and fewer of them, and now we don't have any.<br /><br />You have to keep in mind that, though the moths might be gone, you might still have their tiny eggs lurking around.

They told me that they had previously used the Holistic brand but it had merged with this company & they did not have experience with Eagle Pack but that they thought it was the same. I slowly added the food to my puppy's old food over the next week and she seemed to like it just fine. Well, she started having a lot of loose stools, many of which were completely liquid and even bloody for the next couple of weeks. I decided to try another food and everything completely resolved. I have since tried a couple of puppy foods equal in quality/price/reputation with no problems. Her stools are completely better, now soft but formed (like they should be!) with no sign of blood whatsoever. She has not had any gastrointestinal problems on numerous different kinds of treats either. She has been fine on 3 puppy foods, a dozen different kinds of treats...you do the math.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what the problem may have been from the ingredient list and my concern is the ""triple animal proteins"" combining chicken, pork and fish meals. This is just an invitation for food intolerance because there are more potential allergens. I think the pork is the problem. I know she tolerates chicken & chicken meal fine, not sure about fish but I've seen that frequently in other foods while I have yet to find another quality food that contains pork meal. Pig does not seem akin to a domestic dog's ""natural"" diet anyway. If they got rid of the pork, I might consider trying it again but until then I'd recommend you try another food for your puppy. I think (hope) they are generally a good company and I do see that some people's dogs have been fine on this brand, but I'm not sure this is the safest food for baby animals. I will NOT be purchasing this again & I will be contacting my vet recommending that they no longer carry it in their store. There are so many better, safer options out there.

Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice.

Not Just for Babies, Also for those ordered by Doctors to be on Soft Diet","This is truly amazing, once this arrived; opened box, found them in nicely stacked foil pouches. Small enough for a baby's mouth and yet at the same time is fitting for an Adult likewise who have been ordered on soft food diet (Stage 1 - Puree) or depending on what the Physician has instructed.  I am already on well-known brand name products but there is no comparison with this Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1. Literally had to grab the boxes to compare what's in there and was literally shocked to find out so much of artificial and natural, plus fillers, and concentrate, and yadda, yadda, yadda ... on these brand name products. Not only that, the label on the Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 was very simple; while the shelf life itself will be short because it is all natural.<br /><br />All in all; it is fitting not just for babies, but also for those who have been instructed by Surgeons to Physicians on Soft Food Diet - who are literally sick of this canned repetitive ""Broth, Liquids, and Jell-O"" when one has a craving for ""REAL FOOD"", like Steak, Lobster, Salad, Cheesecake, for example ... stuff ""Big People can eat"".<br /><br />The differences was remarkable! It was not watered down, but yet, was very tasty and addicting. It neither upset my stomach or digestive system even after the harsh medications after taking it, was very soothing.  The other brand names, were kind of frustrating for me (due to nature of injury and then having fallen on Sunday, the day before this arrived from my walker which result more injuries as if I needed it - which result a trip to the hospital that which the photo image shows the Hospital tags) also was instructed to continue on the medications and stay on the soft diet since not able to handle solid foods yet.<br /><br />My elderly mother went out to look for more of these, later then informed me that she wasn't able to find them anywhere only then I noticed they hailed from Canada. Oh Canada, can you teach America to make great foods like these? For not only they are delicious but I will be upfront and first to admit... I was unsure about having Pears, Broccoli, and Spinach all mixed together - I love them all, but together? I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but really, it is very, very good.<br /><br />In my humble opinion - this is excellent for people not just restricted to soft diet with the Doctor's approval, but those with specific medical conditions but not in the late stages where choking is a hazard.<br /><br />It needs no refrigeration unless you had opened it and didn't use it all, it can be closed and used up within 24 hours. It also can be served at room temperature or cold.<br /><br />All in all - I strongly recommend this, the bad thing about it is, I wished this was around when my son was a baby nearly 28 years ago - for this would be the proper food for babies, after having read the packaging and what's all in there, scared me; I never did pay heed to it at all, for I only stuck to the brand name I trusted because it was the same ones that my parents fed my sister and I or have times changed?<br /><br />I also asked my married son to pull out his baby spoon, while he knew not why I asked for it; but what I did was a comparison between the brand names and this on that spoon.  After I squeezed this into the spoon, The looks of it was very appealing to a baby (I know because I have often fed my granddaughter when she was a baby), the other brand names, were so watery, that I found myself constantly having to wipe the spoon which then gave me flash back memories of how many times I had to wipe my granddaughter's face with a spoon, the leakage, and same way with my son when he was a baby. But once I put it into my mouth, each one, there were no differences, the only differences here was that Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees State 1 Juicy Pear and Garden Greens was very tasty over the others where if I were a baby, I would want more.<br /><br />As an Adult on soft food diet, this is a huge relief - where Pears tastes like you just chomped on a fresh Pear, and Broccoli - tastes fresh like one just boiled it fork tender just for you, and Spinach tasted exactly like cooked spinach. Not acidity, no salt, pepper, or any seasoning. It's the way Mother Nature intended it to be; the Pear's own sweetness makes it all the more desirable.<br /><br />All I can say is - elaborately well done and well rounded meal."

I finally drilled holes in the side and riveted a make-shift bracket to either half, effectively sealing the thing together for eternity (or as long as it takes for the plastic to break-down into it's constituent materials). Even now the center tube hardly ""locks"" anymore. I'm done with this toy. The manufacturer needs to redesign the cube halves so the halves screw together.<br /><br />Even when it was brand new the center lock was VERY hard for my wife to get out.

Olives come in a tasty but very salty brine and wine vinegar mixture.  Right out of the keg you can't eat too many because of the salt, but the flavor is very good.  For regular eating we do the following.  We take a portion of the olives, drain and rinse them, and transfer them to another container and fill with cold water.  We let it sit for several hours and change out the water. We repeat this a couple more times with a final wash that is left overnight to 2-days with something added to season and spice them up.

That said...who cares? If you want the Matcha experience, go elsewhere, but if you want all well-documented health benefits of matcha/green tea as well as the convenience of having a powder that will mix with many other foods, this is a great deal.<br /><br />I use about a teaspoon of powder on my morning breakfast cereal, on smoothies, and I use about a quarter of a cup per batch of cookie dough. To date I am on my 24th box since February 2, 2009.<br /><br />About caffeine:<br /><br />Green tea (and therefore matcha) does contain caffeine. Very roughly, one teaspoon contains about as much caffeine as a 6oz cup of black coffee. The caffeine in matcha tends to be released more slowly, though -- over a period of about 6 hours vs. 2 to 3 for coffee. Do not use this in anything you will be consuming before going to sleep!"

For a while I despaired of getting them to eat wet food, as they would just sit there and lick up all the juices, without getting much of the meat.  Typical canned food is just packed too tight, and the texture is not amenable for breaking off little bits with just their tongues.  Finally, I tried out Spot's Stew, which solved the problem.  This food is much looser, I think due to the inclusion of peas and other veggies, and the meat part is just the right consistency where they can lick it up successfully.  At first the cats would eat around the veggies, but they now lick up every morsel, and even prefer the Spot's Stew over the Wellness pouches.  I also like that the food doesn't contain any fish, as one of my cats is allergic to something or other (his back legs are always itchy, and he'll pull out the hair), and the vet suggested it might be fish.  Anyways, thank goodness for Spot's Stew, otherwise my teeth-challenged cats would never have been able to enjoy wet food!"

I have several food allergies but for me this product is not a problem.  Salt content is high, but this is not a problem for me as nothing else in my stew has added salt. If anything else had salt added then the salt content of this beef base would be too high.  Fresh raw meat and vegetables soak up flavor as the stew cooks.  Some frozen vegetables are full of added salt, so I don't use them.  Roast beef from a deli can have added salt and MSG.

The flavors and aroma are so calming and relaxing. I even insisted that my sister-in-law who gifted us with a Keurig coffee maker two years ago, try this. I know she likes certain teas and her coffee black. She could not believe it was tea. I sent her home with a box. The only reason I don't drink it more often is due to the empty calories/sugar. I probably should take a star off for that. I am one who does not like a really strong tea or bold coffee so this really pleases my palate. The Cafe Escapes Chai Latte is hands down my favorite."

As someone who cannot have gluten or casein, I often have difficulty finding good cereals.  Unfortunately, Arrowhead Mills' Organic Maple Buckwheat Flakes continued that trend for me.<br /><br />Some of my complaints about this cereal are common to many -- it gets soggy quickly, it's very expensive for its size, its nutritional value could be better.  What really bothers me, however, is the almost metallic aftertaste it leaves.  Although the ingredients say that it is made with natural maple flavoring, my refined New England maple tastes do not find this flavor to be anything familiar.  It is very strong and very unpleasant.  I found that I have had to brush my teeth immediately after eating each bowl just to get the aftertaste out of my mouth.<br /><br />I usually like Arrowhead Mills products, but this one misses the mark for me.

It's hard to decide whether to leave the dinosaurs in their eggs or take them out of the oatmeal beforehand; I usually take the eggs out, make the oatmeal, and eat the eggs separately (This may not be the best idea, because the sugary ""egg"" around the dinosaur is a large part of what sweetens the oatmeal).  The oatmeal itself is delicious, and tastes very authentic.  The dinosaur eggs were a great incentive when I was younger to eat a healthy breakfast, and they make the entire meal exceptionally better.

I started drinking a small cup (maybe 6 oz) of this once a day and quickly the joint swelling went down as did my limp.

I've tried them all and am on a mission to find soemthing that will keep my pup entertained for a little while and won't break. Kongs don't last for Kobe and as much as he loves squeaky stuffed toys, they don't last more than 10 minutes. Gosh, did I mention he's barely 7 months old - can't fathom how much smarter he will get. SIGH. OK, so you've got an idea what my dog is like onto my review.<br />So I've seen these things both online and at pet stores, and always felt a little unsure about these things. For one thing, these things aren't cheap and two like I've described I've got a really smart Lab. So I broke down and bought this at the pet store after a worker I spoke with highly recommended it. Yes, this was even after I told him about my pup. He said he's got a big dog too who's a ""chewer."" Kobe usually knows when I've bought him something. Soon as I got home, I had to test it out. After 10 mins, not a dent so I was pretty amazed so far. 20 mins later, I see he managed to get that treat out!?!? Sigh...so I pried it out of his mouth and put that slobbery thing back in the ball. Next thing, he had it out again and this time he chewed a good chunk of it so it no longer fit. So I put it in the inner part of the ball and minutes later he got it out of there too. S-I-G-H.<br />I take off 1 star because in my case it was everlasting. I do give it credit for being pretty durable and the treat took a little while longer for him to eat.

Also, it'd be nice if it were a bit saltier -- sometimes you just crave that, especially if it's a meal replacement and you're in a peanut-butter-and-jelly mood -- and a little protein-heavier. Finally, I really wish the entire Larabar line (not just Jocalat) was organic! That would really be awesome. But, these are nitpick-y things. You'll like this flavor -- a lot.

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: ""When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs."" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn."

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

This is only for allergies, if your child doesn't actually need it, you're obviously better served with more tradition formulas (and breast milk :)<br /><br />First try the regular nutrimigen or other hypoallergenic forumulas, then this. We went down the progression and actually saw the symptoms go away. Less random crying and then skin cleared up. It takes some time for it to work just because the allergens in the body from other formulas (or from breastmilk if the mother is eating something child is allergic to) take time to go away. For dairy allergies it can be up to a couple weeks, so really give it some time to work if you think this might be the issue.<br /><br />We did this without recommendation from a doctor, keep in mind that some cases may be beyond the specific expertise of the doctor and you need to do your own troubleshooting to keep your child happy and healthy. We also got confirmation that it worked because I temporarily tried to used regular Enfamil Nutrimigen (which was available from the store locally) while waiting on a shipment of Nutrimigen AA (that I didn't re-order in time).

The problem is the price keeps increasing.  I first purchased these two years ago for about $50 for the box of 12.  Now, two years later, the price seems to be going up every few months.  I'm not sure why the cost increases either.  Rather than purchase a new box of 12, I am recylcling the old bones by cleaning them and inserting something else inside the bone (once the insides have been cleaned out by the dogs).<br /><br />These are hard bones and very difficult to break.  I haven't seen one broken but have seen one of my dogs chew at it breaking the ends.  Sometimes you'll get fat bones in the box with lots of filled product and other times you'll receive thin bones.  The last 12 I purchased, was around $68 for 12.  The entire box had the 6-inch bones but they were all thin, so practically useless.  The box before this last one had fat bones.<br /><br />If the price decreases, I'll buy some new ones to replace the old ones.  I have also purchased the cheese and beef filled bones from the same seller.  Shipping costs are expensive also.  Add the significant cost to purchase the box of 12 plus shipping, and these days it'll run close to $100 which is too expensive for us.<br /><br />I'd recommend the bones, but if you want to try them out first before buying a large quantity, the seller sells singles as well.  If the price decreased back under $60 and the shipping costs were cheaper, I would have given this a 5 star rating."

It has an interesting flavor, but fell short on the two things I really look for in gum - long lasting flavor and fresh breath.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- The flavor is really good. The ginseng adds a bit of exotic spice that compliments the mint nicely.<br /><br />- The texture is great. The outside is crisp, and the inside is so soft that I thought at first that the gum might have a liquid center. Biting into one is really fun.<br /><br />What could have been better:<br /><br />- The flavor drops off quickly. The flavor is really strong for the first minute or so, but after a few minutes, I can barely taste mint. (That last hint of mint does last quite a while, however).<br /><br />- There's little or no breath freshening effect.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the flavor, texture and freshness but I think I can get more for my money -- i.e., gum that leaves me with minty breath and holds its flavor longer.

Of course it's simple: chicken ( I use thighs with skin removed ), a couple cans of stewed tomatoes ( plain is good, Italian better ), can of tomato paste and a half pound of sliced mushrooms. That's it. I put these ingredients in my slow cooker around noon time. A while later ( 4-5 hours on high or 8 hours on low per the instructions ) it's ready. It can be eaten as is or, as we do, put on top of spaghetti. Sometimes to make it even more like spaghetti sauce I'll add a can of marinara ( Hunt's works well ) which is just the right touch and stretches the sauce base.<br /><br />  This dish isn't what you'd call 'gourmet' but when time is an issue using this mix will definitely make life easier. The only down side to using thighs I find is pulling out the bones and other things not wanted. But thighs are inexpensive and tasty. I've also used chicken breast sliced into long strips which is better if you have young ones who just want to dive in and can't watch for those unwanted items.<br /><br />  Along with the chilli mix and the beef stew mix ( both get eaten very quickly around here ) the Italian Herb mix is a good kitchen tool to have when a wholesome, quick meal is called for. It's easily modified to taste and keeps you coming back for more. And buying these mixes from Amazon in bulk packs almost cuts the cost in half compared to individual packs bought at large food stores. Can't beat that!"
467777,B000V1O28Y,A2RL1RS6PWUHWI,Jennifer Ackerman,1,1,4,1337126400,Salty but filling,"My husband will not make more of an effort to feed himself than to heat something up and if I'm not around to provide for him or leave him something already made in the fridge, his immediate go-to is canned soups and canned pastas. As such, I thought these Hormel meals would be a brilliant thing to have around the house. Not only are they right up his alley with being extremely easy to prepare but there is a very wide variety, they come in their own bowl, and you don't need to refrigerate them. I had visions of him keeping a stash at work or in his car and never having to buy lunch if he forgot it at home. Or even him grabbing one for a late night snack and being pleased that he had so many different kinds to choose from.<br /><br />Well, he quickly killed that after trying about four of them. He now will only eat them as a last resort. He's really not all that fond of them. Which leaves me to eat them seeing as how we have so many in the house.<br /><br />The chicken breast and dressing is one of the better ones of the Hormel line but it does have its faults. The gravy is too salty like many of Hormel's products. The dressing, though, is good and filling and I actually prefer it over the potatoes you can find in many of the red meat meals. I'm not normally a fan of celery but the occasional crisp it adds to the dressing is very welcome. The texture gives what would otherwise be a pretty mushy meal, a tiny bit of contrast. The chicken in this is one of Hormel's better meats, mostly because I feel like I'm actually eating meat (which unfortunately isn't always the case with Hormel). I would say that the gravy would be much better with way less salt but I'm afraid if you took the salt away, the flavor would just be a bland, blah bore.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.<br /><br />All I know is that if the end of the world were to come, we have so many of these that we would be set for some while. Well, as long as the end of the world didn't mean the end of working microwaves, that is :)"

I don't know exactly what brings them back, but the traps work well. I've tried others (one with a white disc instead of red) that barely caught one, but these will catch 50 or more! At one point, I thought they disappeared but I realized the traps were almost full and they just weren't flying around.<br />You must be diligent though, don't stop using them because you don't see anymore, wait until they are empty for a while. Don't put them too close to each other, a few feet works better. I have a small kitchen and I put one in the pantry and one on a shelf, one in my den and one in my living room. They don't just stay where they hatch so spread them around.<br /><br />I am hoping as my traps are getting less and less, this is it, but if not, I found this brand works the best.

Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!"

I think I would actually like these better if they were simple multi-grain crackers without the thin brushing of flavoring.<br /><br />Someone looking for a healthy alternative might be happy with these.  If you are a compulsive snacker, then maybe you could get used to the taste.

About three months ago, I went to the grocery store to get some more Quaker instant oatmeal bowls.  I then spotted Seneca Farms oatmeal and noticed the ""just heat up, no need to add water"" message on it.  This really peaked my interest because with the Quaker bowls, I had to go to a coffee maker at work in the morning to get hot water into it from another office to make my oatmeal.<br /><br />Since I had never heard of Seneca before, I grabbed a couple cases to give it a shot.  Let me tell you that the very next day I went back to the grocery store and stocked up on them and have not touched Quaker since.  Yes, its that good.  What really sells is it just goes straight in the microwave for less than a minute.  The apples in the Seneca bowl are a lot chunkier than the ones in Quaker.  I usually have two bowls every morning at work.  This was without a doubt the best oatmeal I've ever eaten.  Absolutely no complaints and only having to heat it up in microwave makes it better.<br /><br />I've also tried their new flavors Apple Cranberry and Maple & Brown Sugar.  The Maple & Brown Sugar doesn't seem sweet enough for me and taste sort of bland, but Apple Cranberry is their best flavor. Apple Cinnamon is awesome, but Apple Cranberry will knock your socks off. I don't know if those two flavors have reached any stores yet, since I had to order mine online from Seneca's website.  I've inquired the local grocery that I visit to get the oatmeal to add the two new flavors and I'm happy to report that they are in the process of adding it to their shelves.<br /><br />Hopefully more stores in my area get Seneca on their shelves because it is really good oatmeal.  So far, only one grocer (Shoppers) stocks it but I'm going to spread the word to my other local grocers.  I have to drive a good distance to get to the only stores that do sell them."

It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.<br /><br />The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.<br /><br />The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.<br /><br />If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.<br /><br />I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought ""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!"""
